\par }\ChapOne{1}{\PP \VerseOne{1}In the beginning, God\FTNT{*}{{\FR 1:1 }
The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).} created the heavens and the earth.
\VS{2}The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\par }{\PP \VS{3}God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
\VS{4}God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.
\VS{5}God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”
\VS{7}God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
\VS{8}God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so.
\VS{10}God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good.
\VS{11}God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so.
\VS{12}The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
\VS{13}There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
\par }{\PP \VS{14}God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years;
\VS{15}and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so.
\VS{16}God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.
\VS{17}God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,
\VS{18}and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
\VS{19}There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
\par }{\PP \VS{20}God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”
\VS{21}God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
\VS{22}God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
\VS{23}There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so.
\VS{25}God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
\par }{\PP \VS{26}God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
\VS{27}God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.
\VS{28}God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\VS{29}God said, “Behold,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 1:29 }
“Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.} I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
\VS{30}To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.
\par }{\PP \VS{31}God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

\par }\Chap{2}{\PP \VerseOne{1}The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.
\VS{2}On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
\VS{3}God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.
\par }{\PP \VS{4}This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh\FTNT{*}{{\FR 2:4 }
“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.} God made the earth and the heavens.
\VS{5}No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,
\VS{6}but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
\VS{7}Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
\VS{8}Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\VS{9}Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\VS{10}A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.
\VS{11}The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
\VS{12}and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium\FTNT{†}{{\FR 2:12 }
or, aromatic resin} and onyx stone are also there.
\VS{13}The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.
\VS{14}The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
\VS{15}Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
\VS{16}Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
\VS{17}but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 2:18 }
or, suitable for, or appropriate for.} him.”
\VS{19}Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name.
\VS{20}The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him.
\VS{21}Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
\VS{22}Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
\VS{23}The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.”
\VS{24}Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.
\VS{25}The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.

\par }\Chap{3}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”
\par }{\PP \VS{2}The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,
\VS{3}but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{4}The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,
\VS{5}for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.
\VS{7}Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.
\VS{8}They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
\par }{\PP \VS{11}God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
\par }{\PP \VS{12}The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”
\par }{\PP The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Yahweh God said to the serpent,
\par }{\Q “Because you have done this,
\par }{\QB you are cursed above all livestock,
\par }{\QB and above every animal of the field.
\par }{\Q You shall go on your belly
\par }{\QB and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
\par }{\Q \VS{15}I will put hostility between you and the woman,
\par }{\QB and between your offspring and her offspring.
\par }{\Q He will bruise your head,
\par }{\QB and you will bruise his heel.”
\par }{\PP \VS{16}To the woman he said,
\par }{\Q “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
\par }{\QB You will bear children in pain.
\par }{\Q Your desire will be for your husband,
\par }{\QB and he will rule over you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}To Adam he said,
\par }{\Q “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,
\par }{\QB and ate from the tree,
\par }{\QB about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’
\par }{\QB the ground is cursed for your sake.
\par }{\Q You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.
\par }{\QB \VS{18}It will yield thorns and thistles to you;
\par }{\QB and you will eat the herb of the field.
\par }{\Q \VS{19}You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,
\par }{\QB for you were taken out of it.
\par }{\Q For you are dust,
\par }{\QB and you shall return to dust.”
\par }{\PP \VS{20}The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.
\VS{21}Yahweh God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—”
\VS{23}Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
\VS{24}So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim\FTNT{*}{{\FR 3:24 }
cherubim are powerful angelic creatures, messengers of God with wings. See Ezekiel 10.} at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

\par }\Chap{4}{\PP \VerseOne{1}The man knew\FTNT{*}{{\FR 4:1 }
or, lay with, or, had relations with} Eve his wife. She conceived,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 4:1 }
or, became pregnant} and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”
\VS{2}Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\VS{3}As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
\VS{4}Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,
\VS{5}but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.
\VS{6}Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
\VS{7}If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”
\VS{8}Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.
\VS{11}Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
\VS{12}From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\VS{14}Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
\VS{17}Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
\VS{18}Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.
\VS{19}Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.
\VS{20}Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
\VS{21}His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.
\VS{22}Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.
\VS{23}Lamech said to his wives,
\par }{\Q “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
\par }{\QB You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
\par }{\Q for I have slain a man for wounding me,
\par }{\QB a young man for bruising me.
\par }{\Q \VS{24}If Cain will be avenged seven times,
\par }{\QB truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”
\par }{\PP \VS{25}Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
\VS{26}A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.

\par }\Chap{5}{\PP \VerseOne{1}This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness.
\VS{2}He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them Adam.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 5:2 }
“Adam” and “Man” are spelled with the exact same consonants in Hebrew, so this can be correctly translated either way.}
\VS{3}Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
\VS{4}The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{5}All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Seth lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh.
\VS{7}Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{8}All of the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.
\VS{10}Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{11}All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{12}Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel.
\VS{13}Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters
\VS{14}and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared.
\VS{16}Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{17}All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch.
\VS{19}Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{20}All of the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{21}Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah.
\VS{22}After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
\VS{23}All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
\VS{24}Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him.
\par }{\PP \VS{25}Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech.
\VS{26}Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{27}All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{28}Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, then became the father of a son.
\VS{29}He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which Yahweh has cursed.”
\VS{30}Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\VS{31}All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
\par }{\PP \VS{32}Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

\par }\Chap{6}{\PP \VerseOne{1}When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
\VS{2}God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.
\VS{3}Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.”
\VS{4}The Nephilim\FTNT{*}{{\FR 6:4 }
or, giants} were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
\par }{\PP \VS{5}Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil.
\VS{6}Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
\VS{7}Yahweh said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground—man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky—for I am sorry that I have made them.”
\VS{8}But Noah found favor in Yahweh’s eyes.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God.
\VS{10}Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\VS{11}The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
\VS{12}God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
\par }{\PP \VS{13}God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.
\VS{14}Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
\VS{15}This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 6:15 }
A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.} its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
\VS{16}You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
\VS{17}I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.
\VS{18}But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
\VS{19}Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
\VS{20}Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive.
\VS{21}Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.”
\VS{22}Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him.

\par }\Chap{7}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.
\VS{2}You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female.
\VS{3}Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
\VS{4}In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”
\par }{\PP \VS{5}Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
\VS{7}Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the floodwaters.
\VS{8}Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
\VS{9}went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
\VS{10}After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth.
\VS{11}In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened.
\VS{12}It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
\par }{\PP \VS{13}In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—
\VS{14}they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
\VS{15}Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship to Noah.
\VS{16}Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then Yahweh shut him in.
\VS{17}The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
\VS{18}The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
\VS{19}The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
\VS{20}The waters rose fifteen cubits\FTNT{*}{{\FR 7:20 }
A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.} higher, and the mountains were covered.
\VS{21}All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.
\VS{22}All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
\VS{23}Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.
\VS{24}The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.

\par }\Chap{8}{\PP \VerseOne{1}God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.
\VS{2}The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
\VS{3}The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters receded.
\VS{4}The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.
\VS{5}The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,
\VS{7}and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
\VS{8}He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
\VS{9}but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship.
\VS{10}He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.
\VS{11}The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
\VS{12}He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more.
\par }{\PP \VS{13}In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
\VS{14}In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}God spoke to Noah, saying,
\VS{16}“Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.
\VS{17}Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.
\VS{19}Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
\par }{\PP \VS{20}Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\VS{21}Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done.

\VS{3}Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.
\VS{4}But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.
\VS{5}I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.

\VS{11}I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”
\VS{12}God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

\VS{14}When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
\VS{15}I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

\VS{21}He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.
\VS{22}Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
\VS{23}Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.

\par }\Chap{10}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
\par }{\PP \VS{2}The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
\VS{3}The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
\VS{4}The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\VS{5}Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
\VS{7}The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.
\VS{8}Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.
\VS{9}He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.
\VS{10}The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\VS{11}Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
\VS{12}and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
\VS{13}Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
\VS{14}Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,
\VS{16}the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
\VS{17}the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
\VS{18}the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
\VS{19}The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.
\VS{20}These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
\par }{\PP \VS{21}Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber.
\VS{22}The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
\VS{23}The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
\VS{24}Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.
\VS{25}To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.
\VS{26}Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
\VS{27}Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
\VS{28}Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
\VS{29}Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.
\VS{30}Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
\VS{31}These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.
\par }{\PP \VS{32}These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.

\par }\Chap{11}{\PP \VerseOne{1}The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
\VS{2}As they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
\VS{3}They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
\VS{4}They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”
\par }{\PP \VS{5}Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.
\VS{6}Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
\VS{7}Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
\VS{8}So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
\VS{9}Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
\par }{\PP \VS{10}This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
\VS{11}Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
\par }{\PP \VS{12}Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.
\VS{13}Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.

\VS{17}Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.

\VS{19}Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.

\VS{23}Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.
\VS{25}Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
\par }{\PP \VS{26}Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.
\VS{28}Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.
\VS{29}Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.
\VS{30}Sarai was barren. She had no child.
\VS{31}Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.
\VS{32}The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.

\par }\Chap{12}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.
\VS{2}I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
\VS{3}I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{4}So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
\VS{5}Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan.
\VS{6}Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land.
\par }{\PP \VS{7}Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.”

\par }{\PP He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.
\VS{8}He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name.
\VS{9}Abram traveled, still going on toward the South.
\par }{\PP \VS{10}There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.
\VS{11}When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.
\VS{12}It will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.
\VS{13}Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
\VS{15}The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
\VS{16}He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
\VS{17}Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
\VS{18}Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?
\VS{19}Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”
\par }{\PP \VS{20}Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.

\par }\Chap{13}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South.
\VS{2}Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
\VS{3}He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
\VS{4}to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name.
\VS{5}Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.
\VS{6}The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.
\VS{7}There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.
\VS{8}Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.
\VS{9}Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
\VS{11}So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves from one other.
\VS{12}Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
\VS{13}Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
\VS{15}for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever.
\VS{16}I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.
\VS{17}Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.

\par }\Chap{18}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
\VS{2}He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
\VS{3}and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.
\VS{4}Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
\VS{5}I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.”
\par }{\PP They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs\FTNT{*}{{\FR 18:6 }
1 seah is about 7 liters or 1.9 gallons or 0.8 pecks} of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”
\VS{7}Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.
\VS{8}He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”
\par }{\PP He said, “There, in the tent.”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.”
\par }{\PP Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
\VS{11}Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
\VS{12}Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child when I am old?’
\VS{14}Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.”
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.
\par }{\PP He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
\par }{\PP \VS{16}The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
\VS{17}Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,
\VS{18}since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
\VS{19}For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.”
\VS{20}Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,
\VS{21}I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”
\par }{\PP \VS{22}The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.
\VS{23}Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?
\VS{24}What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?
\VS{25}May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”
\par }{\PP \VS{26}Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
\VS{27}Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes.
\VS{28}What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”
\par }{\PP \VS{29}He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”
\par }{\PP \VS{30}He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
\par }{\PP \VS{31}He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”
\par }{\PP \VS{32}He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?”
\par }{\PP He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”
\par }{\PP \VS{33}Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

\par }\Chap{19}{\PP \VerseOne{1}The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,
\VS{2}and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”
\par }{\PP They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”
\par }{\PP \VS{3}He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
\VS{4}But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
\VS{5}They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.
\VS{7}He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.
\VS{8}See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”
\par }{\PP \VS{9}They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.
\VS{10}But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
\VS{11}They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\par }{\PP \VS{12}The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:
\VS{13}for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city!”
\par }{\PP But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
\VS{15}When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”
\VS{16}But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.
\VS{17}It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.
\VS{19}See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
\VS{20}See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”
\par }{\PP \VS{21}He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
\VS{22}Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 19:22 }
Zoar means “little”.
}
\par }{\PP \VS{23}The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
\VS{24}Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.
\VS{25}He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
\VS{26}But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.
\VS{28}He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\par }{\PP \VS{29}When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
\par }{\PP \VS{30}Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
\VS{31}The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.
\VS{32}Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”
\VS{33}They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\VS{34}It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”
\VS{35}They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.
\VS{36}Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.
\VS{37}The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
\VS{38}The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

\par }\Chap{20}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.
\VS{2}Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
\VS{3}But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.”
\par }{\PP \VS{4}Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?
\VS{5}Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.
\VS{7}Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.
\VS{9}Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”
\VS{10}Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
\par }{\PP \VS{11}Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’
\VS{12}Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\VS{13}When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.
\VS{15}Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”
\VS{16}To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.
\VS{18}For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

\par }\Chap{21}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.
\VS{2}Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
\VS{3}Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
\FTNT{*}{{\FR 21:3 }
Isaac means “He laughs”.}
\VS{4}Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\VS{5}Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.
\VS{6}Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”
\VS{7}She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
\VS{9}Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
\VS{10}Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”
\par }{\PP \VS{11}The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.
\VS{12}God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac.
\VS{13}I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”
\VS{14}Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\VS{15}The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs.
\VS{16}She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
\VS{17}God heard the voice of the boy.
\par }{\PP The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
\VS{18}Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”
\par }{\PP \VS{19}God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.
\VS{20}God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, became an archer.
\VS{21}He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.
\VS{23}Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”
\par }{\PP \VS{24}Abraham said, “I will swear.”
\VS{25}Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
\VS{26}Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”
\par }{\PP \VS{27}Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.
\VS{28}Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\VS{29}Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?”
\par }{\PP \VS{30}He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”
\VS{31}Therefore he called that place Beersheba,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 21:31 }
Beersheba can mean “well of the oath” or “well of seven”.} because they both swore an oath there.
\VS{32}So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\VS{33}Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
\VS{34}Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.

\par }\Chap{22}{\PP \VerseOne{1}After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”
\par }{\PP He said, “Here I am.”
\par }{\PP \VS{2}He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”
\par }{\PP \VS{3}Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
\VS{4}On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.
\VS{5}Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.”
\VS{6}Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.
\VS{7}Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?”
\par }{\PP He said, “Here I am, my son.”
\par }{\PP He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.
\VS{9}They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
\VS{10}Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
\par }{\PP \VS{11}Yahweh’s angel called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”
\par }{\PP He said, “Here I am.”
\par }{\PP \VS{12}He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
\VS{14}Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh Will Provide”.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 22:14 }
or, Yahweh-Jireh, or, Yahweh-Seeing} As it is said to this day, “On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.”
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Yahweh’s angel called to Abraham a second time out of the sky,
\VS{16}and said, “ ‘I have sworn by myself,’ says Yahweh, ‘because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
\VS{17}that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.
\VS{18}All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{19}So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.
\par }{\PP \VS{20}After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
\VS{21}Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
\VS{22}Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
\VS{23}Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
\VS{24}His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

\par }\Chap{23}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life.
\VS{2}Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
\VS{3}Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,
\VS{4}“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
\par }{\PP \VS{5}The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
\VS{6}“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”
\par }{\PP \VS{7}Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.

\VS{9}that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\VS{11}“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
\par }{\PP \VS{12}Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
\VS{13}He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\VS{15}“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver\FTNT{*}{{\FR 23:15 }
A shekel is about 10 grams, so 400 shekels would be about 4 kg. or 8.8 pounds.} between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.
\par }{\PP \VS{17}So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded
\VS{18}to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
\VS{19}After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
\VS{20}The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.

\par }\Chap{24}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Abraham was old, and well advanced in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
\VS{2}Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.

\VS{7}Yahweh, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring—he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
\VS{8}If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”
\par }{\PP \VS{9}The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
\VS{10}The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
\VS{11}He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
\VS{12}He said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
\VS{13}Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
\VS{14}Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ then she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.

\par }{\PP \VS{21}The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.

\VS{36}Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.
\VS{37}My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
\VS{38}but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’
\VS{39}I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’
\VS{40}He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.
\VS{41}Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’
\VS{42}I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go—
\VS{43}behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”
\VS{44}then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’

\VS{46}She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.
\VS{47}I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
\VS{48}I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.

\par }{\PP \VS{22}Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

\VS{24}Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.
\VS{25}In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
\par }{\PP \VS{26}Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\VS{27}Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.”
\par }{\PP \VS{28}Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.
\VS{29}Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.
\VS{30}He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.
\par }{\PP \VS{31}Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
\VS{32}Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”
\VS{33}She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon.
\VS{34}She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.
\VS{35}She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.

\par }{\PP \VS{3}She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.”
\VS{4}She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her.
\VS{5}Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
\VS{6}Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan.
\VS{7}Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
\VS{8}Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali.
\par }{\PP \VS{9}When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
\VS{10}Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son.

\VS{12}Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son.
\VS{13}Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher.
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”

\VS{17}God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.
\VS{18}Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar.
\VS{19}Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
\VS{20}Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun.
\VS{21}Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.

\par }{\PP \VS{27}Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.”

\par }{\PP \VS{29}Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.
\VS{30}For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”
\par }{\PP \VS{31}Laban said, “What shall I give you?”
\par }{\PP Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.
\VS{32}I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.
\VS{33}So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”
\par }{\PP \VS{34}Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”
\par }{\PP \VS{35}That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
\VS{36}He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
\par }{\PP \VS{37}Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
\VS{38}He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.
\VS{39}The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\VS{40}Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock.
\VS{41}Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive among the rods;
\VS{42}but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
\VS{43}The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

\par }\Chap{31}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.”
\VS{2}Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
\VS{3}Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{4}Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,
\VS{5}and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
\VS{6}You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.
\VS{7}Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me.
\VS{8}If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.
\VS{9}Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.
\VS{10}During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
\VS{11}The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’
\VS{12}He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
\VS{13}I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
\VS{15}Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money.
\VS{16}For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,
\VS{18}and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.
\VS{19}Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim
\FTNT{*}{{\FR 31:19 }
teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.} that were her father’s.
\par }{\PP \VS{20}Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.
\VS{21}So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
\VS{23}He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
\VS{24}God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”
\par }{\PP \VS{25}Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
\VS{26}Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
\VS{27}Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;
\VS{28}and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.
\VS{29}It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’
\VS{30}Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”
\par }{\PP \VS{31}Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’
\VS{32}Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.
\par }{\PP \VS{33}Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
\VS{34}Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them.
\VS{35}She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.
\par }{\PP \VS{36}Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
\VS{37}Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
\par }{\PP \VS{38}“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.
\VS{39}That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
\VS{40}This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.
\VS{41}These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
\VS{42}Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”
\par }{\PP \VS{43}Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
\VS{44}Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{45}Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
\VS{46}Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.
\VS{47}Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 31:47 }
“Jegar Sahadutha” means “Witness Heap” in Aramaic.} but Jacob called it Galeed.\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 31:47 }
“Galeed” means “Witness Heap” in Hebrew.}
\VS{48}Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed
\VS{49}and Mizpah, for he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
\VS{50}If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.”
\VS{51}Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.
\VS{52}May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\VS{53}The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac.
\VS{54}Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.
\VS{55}Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.

\par }\Chap{32}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
\VS{2}When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\par }{\PP \VS{3}Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
\VS{4}He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.
\VS{5}I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’ ”
\VS{6}The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
\VS{7}Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
\VS{8}and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”
\VS{9}Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’
\VS{10}I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.
\VS{11}Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.
\VS{12}You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:
\VS{14}two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\VS{15}thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
\VS{16}He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”
\VS{17}He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’
\VS{18}Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’ ”
\VS{19}He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.
\VS{20}You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’ ” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
\par }{\PP \VS{21}So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.
\VS{23}He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
\VS{24}Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.
\VS{25}When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled.
\VS{26}The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.”
\par }{\PP Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”
\par }{\PP \VS{27}He said to him, “What is your name?”
\par }{\PP He said, “Jacob”.
\par }{\PP \VS{28}He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”
\par }{\PP \VS{29}Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”
\par }{\PP He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him there.
\par }{\PP \VS{30}Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;\FTNT{*}{{\FR 32:30 }
Peniel means “face of God”.} for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”
\VS{31}The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.
\VS{32}Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.

\par }\Chap{33}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants.
\VS{2}He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
\VS{3}He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\par }{\PP \VS{4}Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.
\VS{5}He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”
\par }{\PP He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
\VS{6}Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.
\VS{7}Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”
\par }{\PP Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
\VS{11}Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.
\par }{\PP \VS{12}Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
\VS{14}Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”
\par }{\PP \VS{15}Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.”
\par }{\PP He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
\par }{\PP \VS{16}So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
\VS{17}Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 33:17 }

\VS{2}Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.
\VS{3}His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.
\VS{4}Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”

\VS{8}Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
\VS{9}Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.

\VS{20}Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
\VS{21}“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters.

\VS{27}The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
\VS{28}That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
\VS{29}Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming.
\VS{30}Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
\VS{31}and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.
\VS{32}The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\par }{\PP \VS{33}“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\VS{34}Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.
\VS{35}Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
\VS{36}The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.”
\par }{\PP \VS{37}The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\VS{38}Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”
\VS{39}Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.
\VS{40}You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.”
\VS{41}Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”
\VS{42}Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.
\VS{43}He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt.
\VS{44}Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”
\VS{45}Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
\par }{\PP \VS{46}Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\VS{47}In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.
\VS{48}He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the fields around that city.
\VS{49}Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.
\VS{50}To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
\VS{51}Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,\FTNT{*}{{\FR 41:51 }
“Manasseh” sounds like the Hebrew for “forget”.} “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”
\VS{52}The name of the second, he called Ephraim:\FTNT{†}{{\FR 41:52 }
“Ephraim” sounds like the Hebrew for “twice fruitful”.} “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
\par }{\PP \VS{53}The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
\VS{54}The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\VS{55}When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”
\VS{56}The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
\VS{57}All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.

\par }\Chap{42}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
\VS{2}He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.”
\VS{3}Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
\VS{4}But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.”
\VS{5}The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\VS{6}Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.
\VS{7}Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”
\par }{\PP They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.
\VS{9}Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
\par }{\PP \VS{10}They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.
\VS{11}We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”
\par }{\PP \VS{12}He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
\par }{\PP \VS{13}They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”
\par }{\PP \VS{14}Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’
\VS{15}By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.
\VS{16}Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”
\VS{17}He put them all together into custody for three days.
\par }{\PP \VS{18}Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.
\VS{19}If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
\VS{20}Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”
\par }{\PP They did so.
\VS{21}They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”
\VS{22}Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”
\VS{23}They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
\VS{24}He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
\VS{25}Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
\par }{\PP \VS{26}They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
\VS{27}As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
\VS{28}He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
\VS{29}They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
\VS{30}“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
\VS{31}We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.
\VS{32}We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’
\VS{33}The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
\VS{34}Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{35}As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
\VS{36}Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”
\par }{\PP \VS{37}Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”

\VS{4}If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food;
\VS{5}but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”
\par }{\PP \VS{7}They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
\VS{9}I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;
\VS{10}for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”
\par }{\PP \VS{11}Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
\VS{12}and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
\VS{13}Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.
\VS{14}May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
\par }{\PP \VS{15}The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\VS{16}When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.
\VS{18}The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”
\VS{19}They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
\VS{20}and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.
\VS{21}When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.

\par }{\PP \VS{23}He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them.
\VS{24}The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.
\VS{25}They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\par }{\PP \VS{26}When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him.

\par }{\PP \VS{28}They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.
\VS{29}He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”
\VS{30}Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.
\VS{31}He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”
\par }{\PP \VS{32}They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
\VS{33}They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another.
\VS{34}He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.

\VS{3}As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
\VS{4}When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?
\VS{5}Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’ ”
\VS{6}He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.

\VS{9}With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”

\VS{4}They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
\par }{\PP \VS{5}Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
\VS{6}The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”
\par }{\PP \VS{7}Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\VS{8}Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. The days of the years of my life have been few and evil. They have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”
\VS{10}Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
\par }{\PP \VS{11}Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\VS{12}Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household with bread, according to the sizes of their families.
\par }{\PP \VS{13}There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
\VS{14}Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
\VS{15}When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.
\VS{18}When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.
\VS{19}Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”
\par }{\PP \VS{20}So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.
\VS{21}As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.
\VS{22}Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.
\VS{23}Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
\VS{24}It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”
\par }{\PP \VS{25}They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
\par }{\PP \VS{26}Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
\VS{28}Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
\VS{29}The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,
\VS{30}but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.”
\par }{\PP Joseph said, “I will do as you have said.”
\par }{\PP \VS{31}Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.

\par }\Chap{48}{\PP \VerseOne{1}After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\VS{2}Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.
\VS{3}Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\VS{4}and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’
\VS{5}Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.
\VS{6}Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
\VS{7}As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”
\par }{\PP \VS{9}Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”
\par }{\PP He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”
\VS{10}Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\VS{11}Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”
\VS{12}Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\VS{13}Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.
\VS{14}Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\VS{15}He blessed Joseph, and said,
\par }{\Q “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
\par }{\Q the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
\par }{\Q \VS{16}the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,
\par }{\Q and let my name be named on them,
\par }{\Q and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.
\par }{\Q Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
\par }{\PP \VS{17}When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
\VS{18}Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
\par }{\PP \VS{19}His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”
\VS{20}He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’ ” He set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\VS{21}Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
\VS{22}Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”

\VS{29}He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
\VS{30}in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.
\VS{31}There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:
\VS{32}the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.”
\VS{33}When Jacob finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last breath, and was gathered to his people.

\Chap{50}\VerseOne{1}Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.
\VS{2}Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\VS{3}Forty days were used for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days.
\par }{\PP \VS{4}When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s staff, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\VS{5}‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’ ”
\par }{\PP \VS{6}Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”
\par }{\PP \VS{7}Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\VS{8}All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\VS{9}There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
\VS{10}They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.
\VS{11}When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
\VS{12}His sons did to him just as he commanded them,
\VS{13}for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.
\VS{14}Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.”
\VS{16}They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying,
\VS{17}‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.” ’ Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
\VS{18}His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
\VS{19}Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?
\VS{20}As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today.
\VS{21}Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.
\VS{23}Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees.
\VS{24}Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
\VS{25}Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
\VS{26}So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
